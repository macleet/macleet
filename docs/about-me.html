                <h2># south korea</h2>
                <p>
                    While born in South Korea, I left the country after only a year, 
                    headed straight to Hong Kong without an idea
                    of the where I was going and, for that matter, who I was.

                <h2># hong kong</h2>
                <p>
                    I do not hold many memories of Hong Kong, not due to its insignificance but rather purely due to my infancy.
                    However, my parents seem to hold fond and bittersweet memories, and they seem to have filled the gaps in my
                    memory. Oh, and I used to go by Tommy during this time.

                <p>
                    Out of all the countries I've lived in, Singapore is the one I lived in longest. Therefore, it is the most nostalgic.
                    Here, my best friend was a North Korean, with whom I attended school. We shared many interests, one of which was Naruto,
                    a popular anime series. Such a vibrant and chaotic mind, he introduced me to new activities like water skiing and gaming.

                <p>
                    Across the Hudson river from New York City is a small suburb. Having lived in warmer climates for all my life,
                    I was shook to my core by the Jersey cold. Other than that, I recall there being a group of kids from my school who rode 
                    bikes together around the neighborhood. Wanting to fit in, I pulled out my handy-dandy foldable bike to be among
                    those with BMX bikes. I still had fun though.

                <p>
                    Comfortably back in the heat, I moved to Mumbai (or Bombay). I would be lying if I said that I did not 
                    experience any culture shock. However, once I had settled in, I realized that the country and its people 
                    were warm and inviting. Significantly, the food I had in India is unforgettable, a perfect representation
                    of the liveliness of its culture.

                <p>
                    Back home, I felt like an outsider. A Korean who spoke below-average Korean, unaware of the 
                    cultural and social norms of the country. However, I thankfully was able to adapt to the familiar but unfamiliar setting,
                    and formed the most meaningful relationships of my life. Unrelated, but this was also a time when I realized the decisions
                    I made had real weight and consequences.

                <p>
                    During my time at UC Davis studying computer science,
                    I consistently had doubts about my abilities to excel in the field. And, to an extent, I still do.
                    However, I perhaps realize now that this seeming underconfidence comes with the field due to its fast-paced nature.
                    Therefore, I'm currently striving to change my attitude from 'keeping up' to 'looking forward.'

                <p>
                    After a year of computer science, I began to seriously doubt my prospect in the field. To get more 
                    acquanted with myself and my ambitions, I moved to Seattle to be with my brother. Due to the COVID
                    pandemic, the two years spent there is a blur, but I can say that I developed not only as a worker in
                    a professional environment, but also as a person in general.

                    Without an idea of the where I am going and who I <em>really</em> am, I am currently looking for my
                    next destination, where I can meet new people, make new memories, adapt to new surroundings, share new ideas, 
                    eat new food, experience different cultures, learn new things, and, most importantly, find my new self.
